## Summary
### Positivity Bias
There is a 9.8% higher amount of five star reviews in the Vine program then outside. This can certainly point to a positivity bias for reviews within the program, however this could also be attributed to the fact that there were significantly less total paid reviews than unpaid. The sample size might be too small to be conclusive. 
### Additional Analysis
Another important field in the table is the verified purchase column. If we further filter the unPaid group to only those with a verified purchase, this can help narrow the size of the data set and provide more valid data to analyze and compare to the Vine participants.
